projects


here i have uploaded the code of an online examination live leaderboard...
We can store all the images of the questions in a folder and then it can randomly select questions image from 
that folder And display them when we redirect fron one page to other making sure that none of the questions 
get repeated ..
The user then can answer the questions by selecting the options which gets stored in database at the back end. .
Each user will have their id and password so after the examination we can display the ranksheet of all the
users by applying mysql queries on the database. .
